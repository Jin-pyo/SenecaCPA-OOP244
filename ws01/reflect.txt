Q1. A namespace is a defined space under code where the variables and functions declared are hidden to the rest of the code unless explicitly revealed.

Q2. Header files are needed for function and class definitions. It can be repeatedly included rather then retyped which can also cut down time for debugging.

Q3. They're not compiled because when they're included, the code is being copied and the files containing those copies are already being compiled.

Q4. There would be a duplication in code which can be confusing and would take more time to compile.

Q5. I gained a better understanding of how "namespace" and header files work.
